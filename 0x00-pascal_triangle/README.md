 Pascal's Triangle
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. Here are some key points:

 - Structure:
The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top. Each subsequent row starts and ends with 1.
 - Construction:
Each interior number is the sum of the two numbers above it.
 - Binomial Coefficients:
The numbers in Pascal's Triangle correspond to the coefficients in the binomial expansion.
For example:

    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
Each row n represents the coefficients of the expanded form of (a + b)^n.
